## Launch Requirements

1. **Use Ruby**, a style guide can be found [here](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide), use 2 soft-tabs.
2. Use proper object orientation, abstraction and design patterns.
3. Your application should run as a CLI (command line interface). Should flow like a text based game. in memory data store is fine. The player should be able to play as many missions as they would like. At the end of each mission you should output a summary of the mission. At the end of all missions output the final summary.
4. Once completed, email your point of contact at Doximity a link to your respository.

We know your time is valuable and appreciate you taking the time to complete this assignment. *If any questions come up, please send an email to your Doximity point of contact.*

## Your Mission

_Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to launch the rocket into low earth orbit._

### Specifications

#### You will be responsible for conducting the flight into low earth orbit:

    1. Travel Distance: 160 kilometers
    2. Payload capacity: 50,000 kilograms including rocket itself
    3. Fuel capacity: 1,514,100 liters of fuel, already included in the payload total
    4. Burn rate: 168,233 liters per minute
    5. Average speed: 1500 kilometers/hr

#### The rocket launch system is comprised of 4 stages which must happen in this precise order:

    1. Enable stage 1 afterburner
    2. Disengaging release structure
    3. Cross-checks
    4. Launch

#### Active mission controls:

    1. Manually transition between launch stages in the expected order
    2. Mission control should be able to safely abort launch after stage 1 and retry
    3. One in every 3rd launch will require an abort and retry after stage 1 randomize when it actually happens
    4. One in every 5th launch will explode, randomize when it actually happens

#### Necessary instrumentation information to be provided at the end of each mission

    1. Total distance traveled (if aborted this would be 0, if exploded, pick a random spot in the timeline). 
    2. Total travel time (same as above)

#### Final Summary to be provided at end of all attempted missions.

    1. Total distance traveled (for all missions combined)
    2. Number of abort and retries (for all missions combined)
    3. Number of explosions (for all missions combined)
    4. Total fuel burned (for all missions combined)
    5. Total flight time (for all missions combined)
